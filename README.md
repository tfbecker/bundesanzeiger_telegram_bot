# Bundesanzeiger Financial Data Telegram Bot

This project provides a Telegram bot that fetches financial data from the German Bundesanzeiger (Federal Gazette). Users can send a company name, and the bot will retrieve the latest financial information using natural language processing to extract key financial metrics.

## Features

- üîç Search for companies in the Bundesanzeiger by name
- üí∞ Extract financial data (earnings, total assets, revenue)
- üí¨ Natural language processing with OpenAI
- üìã Caching of financial data to reduce API calls
- ü§ñ Telegram bot interface for easy interaction

## How It Works

1. Users send a company name to the Telegram bot
2. OpenAI's tool calling processes the message to extract the company name
3. The bot searches for the company in the Bundesanzeiger
4. It retrieves and processes the latest financial report
5. OpenAI extracts structured financial data from the report
6. The formatted results are sent back to the user via Telegram

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API Key
- Telegram Bot Token (from @BotFather)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bundesanzeiger_telegram_bot.git
   cd bundesanzeiger_telegram_bot
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```
   # OpenAI API Key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

   # Telegram Bot Configuration
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id

   # Database Configuration (optional)
   DB_PATH=financial_cache.db
   ```

### Running Locally

Start the Telegram bot:

```bash
python scripts/telegram_bot.py
```

## Docker Deployment

### Using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t bundesanzeiger-bot .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name bundesanzeiger-bot \
     -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
     --env-file .env \
     bundesanzeiger-bot
   ```

### Using Docker Compose

1. Start the service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. View logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

## Usage

Once the bot is running, you can interact with it through Telegram:

1. Start a chat with your bot (using the bot username you set in @BotFather)
2. Send a message with a company name, e.g., `Deutsche Bahn AG` or `Show me financial data for BMW`
3. The bot will process your request and respond with the financial information

### Example Commands

- Send a company name: `Siemens AG`
- Ask a question: `What are the financials for Volkswagen?`
- Get help: `/help`

### Timeline Analysis

The bot can generate financial timelines with trend analysis and graphs. Available commands:

- Basic timeline: `timeline 10` - Analyze up to 10 most recent reports
- Select specific reports: `timeline 10 1,2,5,6` or `timeline 10 1-4`
- Filter by company name: `timeline 10 HolzLand Becker GmbH`
- Timeline for specific report: `2 timeline 10`

The bot will ask for confirmation before processing timeline analysis to prevent unwanted operations.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- `bundesanzeiger.py`: Handles scraping and processing of Bundesanzeiger data
- `telegram_bot.py`: Implements the Telegram bot interface
- `telegram_config.py`: Contains Telegram API configuration

### Notes

- The Selenium version (`bundesanzeiger_selenium.py`) is available as a backup if the standard version doesn't work
- Financial data is cached to reduce API calls and improve response time
- The bot indicates whether the data is fresh or cached in its responses

### Error Handling

The bot includes robust error handling for common issues:

- Not finding a company in the Bundesanzeiger database
- Connection issues with the Bundesanzeiger website
- Failed parsing of financial data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Company Not Found**: 
   - The Bundesanzeiger database primarily contains German companies
   - Try using the full legal name (e.g., "BMW AG" instead of just "BMW")
   - Some smaller companies may not be required to publish financial reports

2. **Connection Issues**:
   - The Bundesanzeiger website may occasionally be down or block automated requests
   - Try using the `bundesanzeiger_selenium.py` backup implementation
   - Wait a few minutes and try again

3. **Missing Financial Data**:
   - Some companies may not have all financial metrics available
   - The report may use non-standard formats that are difficult to parse
   - Try requesting a different company

### Logging

For debugging, check the logs:

```bash
# When running locally
python scripts/telegram_bot.py

# When running with Docker
docker logs bundesanzeiger-bot
```

## Security Considerations

- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
- Consider using Docker secrets for production deployments
- Regularly rotate your API keys
